# Coding-Excercise

Given a piece of text, this program maps each word in the text and the number of times it occurred.
The words are sorted by frequency, in descending order.

Added few testcases to test on:
1. If empty text
2. If text has special characters
3. If text includes whitespaces at first or end
4. If text has lowercase and uppercase inputs
